## Hypotheses

1) New Users who land on an ad during their first-ever session will exhibit lower retention rates or higher bounce rate than New users who do not land on an ad during their first-ever session. 
2) New Users who land on an ad during their first-ever session will exhibit lower viewership metrics including session frequency (defined as # of sessions within their first 30 days), Average session duration (ASD) and Minute per user (MPU) than New users who do not land on an ad during their first-ever session. 
3) New Users who land on an ad during their first-ever session will exhibit lower TVMs than New users who do not land on an ad during their first-ever session.

*“Land on ad” experience*: When new users get exposed to ad pod after starting their first episode in less than 5s; For example, a new user joined Pluto and started an episode. In less than 5s after starting the episode, an ad pod showed up and the new user got exposed to the ad pod.
